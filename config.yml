  These notes are going to be left for the gamemaster who doesnt know anything about the scene so far.
  Be sure to make everything past tense so the gamemaster knows it already happened.
  Explicitly state what has already been revealed to the player.
  *** NEVER add anything to the notes that was not said by the player or the gamemaster. ***
  *** NEVER make assumptions or inferences about what the player or gamemaster meant. ***
  *** NEVER attempt to predict what will happened in the future. ***
